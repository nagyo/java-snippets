# Shopping Basket Code Test

You have been asked to model a shopping basket.

You must be able to:
* add items to the shopping basket,
* remove items from the shopping basket,
* empty the shopping basket.

Additionally, you must be able to calculate the total value of the shopping basket. This should account for:
* buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items,
* 10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after previous discount is applied),
* 2% off on total for customers with loyalty cards (after all other discounts are applied).

You must be able to validate that the code works through passing tests.
